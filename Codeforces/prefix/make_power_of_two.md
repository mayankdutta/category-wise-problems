[D. Make a Power of Two](https://codeforces.com/contest/1560/problem/D), Easy
- We just have to figure out that it is asking for prefix of main string, with power of 2, to be matched.
- The string which matched the most, will be tracked.

```cpp
void solve() {
    std::string s;
    std::cin >> s;

    int res = 1E9;

    for (int i = 0; i < 64; i++) {
    std::string t = std::to_string(1ULL << i);

        int k = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < int(s.length()); j++) {
            if (k < int(t.length()) && s[j] == t[k]) {
                k++;
            }
        }
        
        res = std::min(res, int(s.length()) + int(t.length()) - 2 * k);
    }
    std::cout << res << "\n";
}
