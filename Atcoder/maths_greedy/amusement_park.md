- Straight fwd problem if done simpler one.
- Idea just to apply `priority queue / multiset / map` will lead to **TLE**.

  <summary> Naive solution, gave TLE</summary>

```cpp
  void solve() {
      int n, k;
      cin >> n >> k;
      ll ans = 0;

      priority_queue<int> pq;
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
          int num;
          cin >> num;
          pq.push(num);
      }

      while (k-- and !pq.empty()) {
          auto curr = pq.top();
          pq.pop();
          ans += curr;
          if (curr - 1 > 0)
              pq.push(curr - 1);
      }
      cout << ans << '\n';
  }

```

<summary> Above approach with few optimization. </summary>

```cpp
int n;
long long int K;
scanf("%d%lld", &n, &K);
map<long long int, long long int> mp;
for (int i = 0; i < n i++) {
    long long int a;
    scanf("%lld", &a);
    ++mp[a];
}
priority_queue<pair<long long int, long long int> que;
for (auto [key, val] : mp)
    que.emplace(key, val);
que.emplace(0, 0);

long long int ans = 0;
while (K > 0 && que.top().fi > 0) {
    auto [element, freq] = que.top();
    que.pop();
    long long int diff = element - que.top().first;

    if (diff * freq <= K) {
        K -= diff * freq;
        ans += sum(element, element - diff) * freq;
        freq += que.top().second;
        que.pop();
        que.emplace(element - diff, freq);
    } else {
        diff = K / freq;
        ans += sum(element, element - diff) * freq
            + (element - diff) * (K % freq);
        break;
    }
}
printf("%lld\n", ans);
```

##### Approach

- no.s stored in array, frequency wise.
- for a certain element the no.s of element to be shifted down (i.e. -1, till the last smallest element in our queue) will be `that element * it's frequency`
- if this value `element * its_freq` is `<= k`.
  - then accordingly smaller element in queue is updated, ans. is updated as well.
- else
  - we have to check, with current value of `k` how many elements we can shift down.
  - then we will `value down` till that value,
  - **CORNER CASE** even if some value of `k` got left as a remainder, we would have to settle this by furher decreasing the value elements.
  - Above point is taken care of by line `(element - diff) * (K % diff)`.
