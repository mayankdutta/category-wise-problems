[Blackboard GCD](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc125/tasks/abc125_c)

#### Slight description.

- Problem was to get the maximum gcd if we exclude one no.

<details>
  <summary> Sample code </summary>

```cpp
int n;
cin >> n;

vector <int> arr (n + 2, 0);
vector <int> prefix (n + 2, 0);
vector <int> suffix (n + 2, 0);

for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) cin >> arr[i];

for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
    prefix [i] = gcd (prefix[i-1], arr[i]);
}

for (int i=n; i>=1; i--) {
    suffix [i] = gcd (suffix[i+1], arr[i]);
}

int mx = 0;
for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) {
    mx = max (gcd(prefix[i-1] ,suffix [i+1]), mx );
}

cout << mx << "\n";
```

- Things I learnt
  - was new approach to me.
- similar questions
  - to be added.
