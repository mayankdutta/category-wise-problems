- Utilizes the concept of topological sorting.
- Innvolves basic of dynamic programming(_dont sweat, it's just fibonacci type_)
- Approach
  - We wish to first order our edges in terms of their requirement (i.e. we are going to apply topological sort)
    - Why?, so that we can later apply dp in right order.
  - then, we will be storing `no. of ways` as DP.
  - initializing `dp[0] = 1`, and then storing like fibonacci type.
  - very simple dp innvolved.
  - also we had to traverse in reverse order of directed edge, hence two graphs were taken.
    - Why?(try dry run test cases)

```cpp
int n, m;
std::cin >> n >> m;

std::vector<int> graph[n + 1], revGraph[n + 1], inEdge(n + 1);
for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int a, b;
    std::cin >> a >> b;
    graph[a].push_back(b);
    revGraph[b].push_back(a);
    inEdge[b]++;
}

std::queue<int> qu;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (inEdge[i] == 0) {
        qu.push(i);
    }
}

std::vector<int> order, dp(n + 1, 0);
while (!qu.empty()) {
    auto u = qu.front();
    qu.pop();
    order.push_back(u);
    for (const auto &v : graph[u]) {
            if (--inEdge[v] == 0) {
                qu.push(v);
            }
    }
}

dp[0] = dp[1] = 1;
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int u = order[i];
    for (const auto &v : revGraph[u]) {
        dp[u] += dp[v];
        dp[u] %= mod;
    }
}
std::cout << dp[n] << '\n';
```
