1. Given a string S, find the second non-repeatign character of S. String contains lower case characters only. If no such character exist then return "-". <br>
    *Input*
    ```txt
    abbcdefgabbcdabcg
    ```
    *output*: `f`

    **NOTE**: the solution should be implemented with O(N) time complexity and constant space. 
 
2. A tree is considered special if the sums of all the nodes at each level are in AP, Given the root note of a binary tree. 
  Return an array representting the minimum number that can be added at each

      *Input*
      ```txt
         3
        / \
       2   7
       \
        15

      ```

      *output*: `[0, 0, 0]`
      
      
      *Input*
      ```txt
         17
        / \
       11  5
            \
            12

      ```

      *output*: `[0, 0, 3]`
      

3. Given a linked list, arrange the linked list in the manner of alternate last and first. Make sure to ......(not readable) 
  **NOTE** the solution should be implemented with O(n) time complexity and constant space. 

      *Input*
      ```txt
         1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8
      ```

      *output*: `8 -> 1 -> 7 -> 2 -> 6 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4`

4. Given a sorted array containing N integers, both +ve and -ve. 
   Create another array containing the sqares of all the elements in the input array and return it ... (not readable)
   **NOTE** Exptected time complexity O(n)
  

      *Input*
      ```txt
       [-7, -5, -2, 0, 1]
      ```

      *output*: `[0, 1, 4, 25, 49]`
 

4. Provided a sorted linked list, write a program to delete all the nodes having duplicate no.s 
   Create another array containing the sqares of all the elements in the input array and return it ... (not readable)
   **NOTE** Exptected time complexity O(n) and constant space. 
  

      *Input*
      ```txt
       2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 5 -> 6 -> 6 -> 8
      ```

      *output*: `2 -> 4 -> 8`
      
      *Input*
      ```txt
       2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 
      ```

      *output*: `4 -> 5`
 
 
5. Provided a binary tree containing digits only from 0 - 9, each root to leaf path represents a no. Return the total sum of 
  Return an array representting the minimum number that can be added at each

      *Input*
      ```txt
         2
        / \
       3   5

      ```

      *output*: `48`, explanation: `2 -> 3 == 23, 2 -> 5 == 25`
