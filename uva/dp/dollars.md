- UNORDERED counting.
- whatif we wish to calculate no. of solutions
- Solution mentioned below didn't work on mentioned problem, **WHY?** (answered in second mentioned)
- given that each combination is counted differently
- States are only in this case, `remaining money`
- Pay attention to the for loop in the sample code's recursive function.
- What this doing is running the loop from 0, hence forcing it to count every possible combinations.
- If we don't wish to do so, we will have to pass the index from where it should continue counting.

- ORDERED counting
- True coin change problem via memoization.
- States as discussed in above one are two, `remainging money, current index`
- advised to use `memo 2d array` such as **LESS ROWS, MORE COLS**, _i may be wrong_
- surprisingly if `memo 2d array` declared as mentioned, code will be faster.
